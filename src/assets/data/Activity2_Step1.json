You will also learn to identify when a point on the graph is a solution to the linear inequality.<br><br> When you graph a linear inequality, you first draw its boundary line on the coordinate plane. The boundary line splits the coordinate plane into two regions, one whose points satisfy the inequality and the other whose points do not. The region that satisfies the inequality is usually shaded to show the solutions of the inequality. To create the boundary line, you set both sides of the inequality equal to each other and draw that line.<br><br> Set m = 2 and b = 0 by using the sliders or by typing the values in the input boxes.
